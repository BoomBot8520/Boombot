CIRCUIT :-
Design for the Motors that will run the Wheels of the robot. Differential Drive System implemented.



-- 4 motors with similar circuits are connected to 4 different pins on the Arduino board.
-- Capacitors and Diodes have been used to eliminate unnecessary analog noise in the motor. The diode stops current backflow, and the capacitor filters AC noises.
-- npn transistor has been used as a switch, and is biased in active region. When base voltage reached threshold, current is allowed to flow to the ground through emitter.
-- The base of the npn transistor is connected to the Arduino Pin, which emits a PWM (Pulse Width Modulated) signal.
-- Each motor requires a 9V battery to operate it.
