CIRCUIT :-
DC to AC Inverter Circuit using MOSFET H-Bridge connections



-- The DC battery voltage is converted into AC via an H-Bridge connection. 4 MOSFETS are used in the circuit - 2 PMOS and 2 NMOS.
-- The MOSFET gates are supplied voltage via Arduino pins.
--  The frequency of the AC voltage is determined by adjusting the delay time in turning the MOSFETS on/off.
-- This circuit converts the DC to a square wave pulse. The square wave is then converted to sinusoidal wave via a low-pass filter.
-- Due to significant voltage loss in the circuit, it is advisable to attach a transformer at the end of the low-pass filter. It is not shown in this circuit.
-- The oscilloscope measures the output voltage.
-- It is a self-working circuit. Once started, it does not need to be manned.
-- This circuit uses only 4 Arduino Pins, so it can easily be absorbed into another Arduino board to save space.
